## API
The Aplication Program Interface (API) is available in the following Documentation \\

API URL: https://apirest-qywgms5y2q-ue.a.run.app/?fbclid=IwAR0IbPBfwr7tippjae8Ug3jlF4qv1g8hSJwK9D63o4XkopMzikZ2A_TN55c \\

DPCUMENTATION URL: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/27080186/2s9YkgEkzd 

The API runs on a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) server that allows us to connect to the application and make requests to get the information from the database. In addition, the database is deployed in GCP Cloud SQL.

If you want to run the API locally, you must follow these steps:
- Clone this repository in the desired directory.
- Create a virtual environment in the directory, for example:
.\Venv\Scripts\activate.
- Activate the virtual environment:
 .\Venv\Scripts activate
- Run the file apirest.py:
python apirest.py
